If the order still does not arrive then reach us at <a href="mailto:support@alineter.com" class="helpline">support@alineter.com</a> or call us at <a href="tel:8895738760" class="helpline">+91 8895738760</a>.</p>

            <p>Customers are always our first priority. After you’ve applied for a return and we’ve confirmed your request; we will automatically initiate your refund.

            <p>We totally get you that Cash on Delivery is by far the most popular payment method. But for the past months Covid-19 has made it difficult. We are putting your health as our utmost priority; hence, not accepting physical payments to avoid the spreading of virus. And on the bright side, this supports our initiative for a digital India.</p>
